## Introduction
How do we measure stars distance? The astronomers have discovered ingenious methods to do it. The main two are parallax and the use of standard candles, that is events or objects that share common characteristics that allow to know their brightness. One type of candles are known as cepheids, which are stars that shine in a periodic manner in just days or less as it’s showed below. In contrast to the rest of stars that change brightness only due to “random” fluctuations, or the star aging which delay millions of years. In this case we will look for them using Kepler’s data. 

## Methodology.
To find such cepheids we have to perform a senoidal regression to our data. In general cepheids must look like a sine/cosine curve. To find such stars, a python script was created using the Fast Fourier Transform implementation of Sci-py. Finally I created a Power BI report which utilizes Python Visuals. 

## Results Overwiew.
The results of the new method are showed below. Note: You have to install Python, Power BI, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib in your computer in order to make the report work out.
