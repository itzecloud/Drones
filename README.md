How do we measure stars distance? The astronomers have discovered ingenious methods to do it. The main two are parallax and the use of standard candles, that is events or objects that share common characteristics that allow to know their brightness. One type of candles are known as cepheids, which are stars that shine in a periodic manner in just days or less as it’s showed below. In contrast to the rest of stars that change brightness only due to “random” fluctuations, or the star aging which delay millions of years. In this case we will look for them using Kepler’s data.
